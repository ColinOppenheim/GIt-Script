# Welcome to the RTMFM

_This repo is here to keep all the things and teach all the things because so many other tools we have on keeping information or taking notes do the opposite of blow._

## Here are a list of Dont's and Do's

### **Don't** -
- _Hoard knowledge, if you kept everything, where would you put all of it?_
- _Commit Binaries to Git, there is now a [GitLFS](https://git-lfs.com/) for that_
- _Operate in a vacuum, if you need help or are struggling do not hesitate to ask._

### **Do** - 
- _Improve upon the list of Dont's - Growth through pain is inevitable, but it doesn't mean others should have to repeat your mistakes either._
- _Share your knowledge and include hints, easter eggs, trivia, sci-fi references, memes, gifs, obscure pop-culture references that those with a real or imaginary man-bun may not fully understand and other delitful treats to keep our sense of humor well stocked for a looooooooong journey._
- _Use the Cheatsheet provided below for examples on how to make your RTFM documents the best that they can be. Please feel free to add to this document as new more obscure markdown abilities get added to your utility belt, so that you may share your tools with the rest of the class._
